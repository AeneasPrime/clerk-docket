The meeting was called to order at 7:09 p.m. by Council President Harris followed by the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nPresent were Councilmembers Brescher, Coyle, Patel, Patil, Pointer, Shmuel and Council President Harris.\n\nAlso present were Township Clerk Russomanno, Deputy Township Clerk McCray, Township Attorney Rainone, Business Administrator Alves-Viveiros, CFO Vallejo, Chief Administrative Officer DeRoberts and Cameraman Bhatty.\n\nThe Township Clerk advised that adequate notice of this meeting, as required by the Open Public Meetings Act of 1975, has been provided by an Annual Notice sent to The Home News Tribune, The Star Ledger, Desi Talk and News India Times on November 18, 2024 and posted in the Main Lobby of the Municipal Complex on the same date.\n\nThis meeting is available on the following link:\n\nhttps://cablecast.edisonnj.org/internetchannel/show/3921\n\n1.      COUNCIL PRESIDENT'S REMARKS\n\nCouncil President Harris announced a presentation on the lost history of Lincoln Highway in New York and New Jersey on Sunday, October 26th at 3 p.m. at the Masonic Lodge at 483 Middlesex Avenue, followed by refreshments. She also announced a presentation by Dr. Inger Auerbach on memories of a child survivor of the Holocaust on Tuesday, November 4th from 2 to 3 p.m. at the Low Media Amphitheater LH205, Middlesex College, with a book signing to follow.\n\n2.      APPROVAL OF MINUTES\n\nOn a motion made by Councilmember Brescher seconded by Councilmember Patil and duly carried, the Minutes of the Worksession and Regular Meeting of [REVIEW: date not clearly stated] were accepted as submitted. Councilmembers Patil and Shmuel abstained as they were not present at that meeting.\n\n3.      NEW BUSINESS\n\nPROPOSED ORDINANCES PUBLIC HEARING SET DOWN FOR WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 2025.\n\n        O.2261-2025    ORDINANCE AMENDS THE PUBLIC SPEAKING TIME TO SIX MINUTES DURING THE PUBLIC \n        COMMENTS PORTION OF THE PUBLIC MEETINGS\n\n        Councilmember Coyle stated he would not support the six minutes but would support five minutes if that were proposed. Council President Harris noted this was an election year with three new members likely joining Council in January and suggested deferring the ordinance, stating she would vote no on introduction.\n\n        Councilmember Patel noted meetings extend only when there are controversial issues and suggested the Council President could have authority to adjust speaking time when many residents attend, as the Board of Education does. Mr. Rainone clarified the Council must abide by ordinance and cannot change speaking time based on attendance. Councilmember Patel stated he would support five minutes if proposed but was willing to support six minutes.\n\n        Councilmember Brescher stated he would support the ordinance, noting he has taken the position to let people speak and that Council takes time for its own due diligence. He agreed new members would join next year and would prefer deferring to next year, but stated he would support it out of respect for the Council President.\n\n        Council President Harris delivered remarks noting she was asked by a councilmember to postpone the ordinances until after the election but that councilmember said he would ultimately vote no and would not vote to introduce. She stated the percentage of residents not attending meetings is likely greater than 95% but the ordinance is about those who do attend. She noted no one has been removed from a meeting on her watch and that it is not about the number of minutes but how they are managed. She stated the four councilmembers who voted to reduce speaking time did not show respect by granting her request to move the vote until she returned from being away. She asked Council to approve the ordinances for introduction.\n\n        On a motion made by Councilmember Brescher seconded by Councilmember Patil this Ordinance failed on first reading on the following roll call vote:\n\n        AYES - Councilmembers Brescher, Patil and Council President Harris\n        NAYS - Councilmembers Coyle, Patel, Pointer, Shmuel\n\n        O.2262-2025    ORDINANCE AMENDS REBUTTAL TO THE PUBLIC SPEAKING TIME DURING THE PUBLIC \n        COMMENTS PORTION OF THE PUBLIC MEETINGS\n\n        Mr. Rainone explained the ordinance would allow any member of the public to respond to comments made by other members of the public or Council in opposition to what has been stated. If a member of the public spoke in favor of legislation and an individual never had opportunity to speak in opposition, they would have opportunity to get up for that purpose only.\n\n        Councilmember Brescher questioned whether someone could rebut another resident on any of the resolutions on the agenda. Mr. Rainone clarified the rebuttal is for the purpose of ensuring someone who did not get to speak on an item hears something in public comment and wants an opportunity to speak in opposition so Council gets a fuller picture.\n\n        Councilmember Brescher expressed concern about residents rebutting each other and cited a problem where residents speak and Council gives an answer unrelated to their question but the resident cannot rebut from their seat. Mr. Rainone explained rebuttal is not for that purpose but for opposing viewpoints on legislation.\n\n        On a motion made by Councilmember Brescher seconded by Councilmember Patil this Ordinance failed on first reading on the following roll call vote:\n\n        AYES - Councilmembers Brescher, Patil and Council President Harris\n        NAYS - Councilmembers Coyle, Patel, Pointer, Shmuel\n\n        O.2263-2025    ORDINANCE AMENDING CHAPTER SEVEN TRAFFIC OF THE TOWNSHIP CODE TO REGULATE \n        CERTAIN ELECTRIC SCOOTERS\n\n        Councilmember Brescher confirmed this is the amended version distributed that day.\n\n        Councilmember Brescher thanked the administration for discussing concerns and revising violation and penalty fees. Amendments included prohibiting hitching while on a scooter, requiring both hands on handles, requiring lights at night, requiring a kickstand, requiring a bell to pass people, and establishing a warning system for violations by those under 16. First offense results in warning to parent or guardian, second offense warning and/or fine up to $100 to parent or guardian, third offense $250 fine to parent or guardian, and fourth offense increased fee.\n\n        Councilmember Coyle asked if the ordinance allows scooters on bike lanes. Mr. Rainone stated his inclination is it is not permissible but he would confer with the Police Department. Ms. Alves-Viveiros noted the ordinance addresses immediate safety concerns and e-bikes were not addressed. She stated they can discuss with the Chief and potentially combine the two later.\n\n        Councilmember Patel expressed concern about becoming too restrictive on micromobility as cars become expensive and noted the light transit system under development. Ms. Alves-Viveiros stated they will provide information on the light transit plan.\n\n        Councilmember Patil stated he recognizes public safety concerns but is not prepared to introduce today. He would support at the next meeting after review with the Chief and other Council members. If Council supports introduction today he will support the ordinance itself.\n\n        Council President Harris thanked Councilmember Brescher for his thorough review and stated the amendments are good additions.\n\n        On a motion made by Councilmember Brescher seconded by Councilmember Patel this Ordinance was passed on first reading and ordered published according to law for further consideration and Public Hearing at the next Regular Meeting of the Township Council to be held on November 12, 2025.\n\n        AYES - Councilmembers Brescher, Patel, Patil, Pointer, Shmuel and Council President Harris\n        NAYS - Councilmember Coyle\n\n4.      PUBLIC COMMENTS AS TO PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS\n\nCouncil President Harris opened the meeting to the public for comments on Proposed Resolutions R.561-2025 through R.584-2025.\n\nJoel Levinsohn, Beach Lane, asked where on Resolution R.561 report of disbursements the cost overruns for the sports center in Papaianni Park would appear and asked if there is a cost to the Township for the lease for the police substation at Menlo Park Mall. Ms. Alves-Viveiros stated sports center costs would appear under capital funding and the latest change order brought the total project to approximately $12.5 million with change orders of approximately $800,000 or 8-9% of overall costing. Mr. Rainone clarified the substation lease is one dollar.\n\nDr. Vikas Mittal, [REVIEW: address unclear], asked about Resolutions R.561, R.562, R.563, R.564 and R.565 regarding refunds. CFO Vallejo explained these are refunds related to credit card system problems that occurred in September and the contract finishes November 19th. Mr. Rainone clarified when accounts are reconciled there may be refunds and this happens regularly every other Council meeting.\n\nThere were no other comments from the public regarding Proposed Resolutions. On a motion made by Councilmember Brescher seconded by Councilmember Patil and duly carried, the public hearing was closed.\n\n5.      CONSENT AGENDA\n\nCouncilmember Brescher requested Resolution R.582-2025 be pulled for separate vote. Council President Harris requested Resolution R.583-2025 be pulled. Councilmember Patil requested Resolution R.584-2025 be pulled.\n\nThe following Resolutions R.561-2025 through R.581-2025 were adopted under the Consent Agenda on a motion made by Councilmember Brescher and seconded by Councilmember Patil.\n\n        AYES - Councilmembers Brescher, Coyle, Patel, Patil, Pointer, Shmuel and Council President Harris\n        NAYS - None\n\n        R.561-2025    RESOLUTION [REVIEW: title not stated]\n        [Additional resolution numbers and titles through R.581-2025 - full list not provided in transcript]\n\n6.      INDIVIDUALLY VOTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n        R.582-2025    [REVIEW: title not stated - emergency contract resolution]\n\n        Councilmember Coyle asked if Fletcher Cramer is part of the emergency contract and noted they are one of three firms listed. He stated he would support but was not happy with Fletcher Cramer's performance during the former Chair Avenue emergency where he was on scene for three days.\n\n        R.583-2025    [REVIEW: title not stated - Menlo Park Mall lease]\n\n        Council President Harris asked the cost of the lease. Mr. Rainone stated it is zero, noted as one dollar but essentially zero, for a five year term.\n\n        R.584-2025    RESOLUTION [REVIEW: title not stated - Diwali fireworks]\n\n        Councilmember Patil thanked Council and administration for approving fireworks for the Diwali celebration on October 25th, noting this is the fourth year and thousands of residents will attend.\n\n        Council President Harris wished everyone Happy Diwali and Happy New Year and asked residents to be mindful of neighbors and not do fireworks late at night.\n\n        On a motion made by Councilmember Brescher seconded by Councilmember Patil, Resolutions R.582-2025, R.583-2025 and R.584-2025 were adopted on the following roll call vote:\n\n        AYES - Councilmembers Brescher, Coyle, Patel, Patil, Pointer, Shmuel and Council President Harris\n        NAYS - None\n\n7.      ORAL PETITIONS AND REMARKS\n\nCouncil President Harris opened the meeting for public comment.\n\nJoel Levinsohn, Beach Lane, stated free speech is under assault nationally and expressed disappointment Council did not allow more free speech. He asked about affordable housing litigation. DCA calculated Edison has fair share obligation of 727 units while Edison calculated 682 units. Edison could have filed its numbers with DCA in January which would have had presumption of validity and immunity from builders remedy lawsuits with disputes resolved through DCA arbitration. Instead Edison filed declaratory judgment action in Superior Court and is now embroiled in litigation against four developers plus Fair Share Housing Center plus New Jersey Builders Association. Litigation has generated at least 27 motions, briefs and memoranda. Court ruled against Edison accepting DCA calculation of 727 units and stated Edison does not have immunity from builders remedy lawsuits. He asked how much Edison has spent on litigation, what is the advantage to Edison for taking the declaratory judgment route rather than dispute resolution, and can the administration admit an error in judgment was made.\n\nMr. Rainone stated the premise of the question is incorrect. The judge ruled the number is 727 but Edison can take a vacant land adjustment which takes into account what is developable and will reduce the number dramatically even below Edison's suggested number. The statement that Edison is susceptible to builders remedy lawsuits is incorrect. Four developers entered litigation asserting they must be part of a plan and Edison will negotiate with them, but immunities are still in place for every other potential developer. He stated the strategy has been explained multiple times and he believes this is good news with Edison working toward a reasonable number based on developable land.\n\nCouncilmember Patel stated whether the number is 750, 650, 550 or 850 is irrelevant because the difference is only about 100 units across the whole town. He noted the prior administration had a settlement involving 2000 units spread over multiple rounds.\n\nCouncilmember Coyle expressed concern that in 20 or 30 years when deed restrictions expire Edison will owe those units again and suggested looking into alternatives beyond buying back restrictions.\n\nCouncilmember Brescher stated the difference between 727 and 682 is 45 units across a timeline. He supports affordable housing as Edison is expensive to move to. The timeline to reach the requirement will take a long time as only a percentage of any development is affordable housing.\n\nAnthony Damron, Wiley Avenue, disagreed with Councilmember Brescher's position that Edison is unaffordable. He questioned what has been done to make it affordable and stated affordable housing is a disaster. He noted Edison has no seat at the table deciding who gets the homes and compared it to not being able to afford Beverly Hills. He stated his father worked hard to buy a home and residents are just skating by. He disagrees with the concept and thinks the town should push back. He asked if there is an ordinance requiring bicycle helmets for children and asked why the six minute speaking time issue needs to be solved.\n\nCouncilmember Brescher noted state law requires helmets for those 14 and under for bicycles.\n\nMr. Rainone noted several municipalities filed a lawsuit regarding recent DCA numbers but that lawsuit failed.\n\nCouncil President Harris asked how Millburn and other wealthy towns pushed off affordable housing. Mr. Rainone stated he would look into it but noted wealthy towns used litigation to delay and the new law uses arbitration to speed the process.\n\nGloria Glover, [REVIEW: address unclear], asked everyone to speak into the microphone and asked staff to identify themselves. She thanked Council President Harris for bringing up the six minute ordinance and stated Council is supposed to listen to residents. She asked about the North Edison Library work stoppage, expressed concern about traffic at the Asian food market on Route 1, supported the scooter law, and noted concern about seven fires from fireworks.\n\nCouncilmember Coyle stated he will look into the library situation. He explained a subcontractor has a claim for prevailing wage which is being investigated and can hold up projects.\n\nMs. Alves-Viveiros introduced CFO Vallejo and Chief Administrative Officer DeRoberts.\n\nElizabeth Conway, [REVIEW: address unclear], asked for the road resurfacing schedule and asked what happens if Council does not answer a question during public comment as rebuttal would not apply. She noted fireworks went beyond legal fireworks with bombs going off at 9:30-10 p.m. and she called Police Sergeant [REVIEW: name unclear]. She asked if helmets are required for scooters and stated two of three councilmembers will be remembered for blocking the six minute ordinance.\n\nMs. Alves-Viveiros stated the resurfacing schedule is online and will ensure it is updated.\n\nMr. Rainone stated the Open Public Meetings Act is clear this section is public comment not question and answer with no legal right to have questions answered.\n\nMr. Rainone stated the scooter ordinance requires all persons operating a scooter to wear a properly fitted and fastened helmet.\n\nCouncilmember Patel asked where the road list is on the website. Ms. Alves-Viveiros stated it is under engineering projects.\n\nSammy Sharma, [REVIEW: address unclear], asked about the budget for the Diwali festival at Lake Papaianni, how much is being paid to police and firefighters, how much sponsorship from Patel Brothers, and traffic arrangements.\n\nMs. Alves-Viveiros stated the fireworks and drone show are fully funded by outside donors and she can provide numbers after the event. Traffic is handled by Police with parking at multiple locations and shuttle services.\n\nCouncilmember Coyle stated the Police traffic division does a phenomenal job at these events.\n\nCouncilmember Patil noted this is a Township event well organized and well planned with donations secured by the Mayor.\n\nCouncil President Harris stated this is one of the most successful festivals with one of the largest crowds.\n\nThomas Luckie, [REVIEW: address unclear], asked about feedback protocol for citizen requests as there is no response confirming issues are addressed. He noted fireworks going off at 9-11 p.m. and thanked the Clerk's office for addressing his concerns about the Tax Collector's office.\n\nMs. Alves-Viveiros stated the Township has an app where residents can submit issues with photos and track them.\n\nCouncilmember Patel asked if the road condition data can be made publicly available. Ms. Alves-Viveiros stated she will check with the Township Attorney as that is data they work through.\n\nMr. Rainone stated fireworks timing would be subject to the noise ordinance and he will review the language.\n\nCouncilmember Coyle stated he has had great experience with the Tax Collector's office and noted these are Edison residents who have worked there for years.\n\nDr. [REVIEW: first name unclear] Mittal, Pleasant Avenue, asked about Amboy Avenue repaving schedule, who is responsible for cutting branches on Amboy Avenue, why sidewalk by [REVIEW: business name unclear] is not wide enough, why street signs at Amboy and Little Avenue are missing, who reports street lights on Amboy Avenue, suggested a shoulder on Calvert Avenue to reduce speeding, asked if warehouses and distribution centers are defined, asked what ordinances have been created to align with the Master Plan, asked if all councilmembers have assigned board roles, and asked why he has not been appointed to library board, human relations committee, environmental commission or citizens advisory committee despite applying and attending meetings.\n\nMs. Alves-Viveiros stated Amboy Avenue repaving will start in springtime and other maintenance issues will be referred to engineering and DPW. She recommended using [REVIEW: system name unclear] to submit requests.\n\nMr. Rainone stated BFJ Planning was authorized by resolution in July to formulate ordinances to align with the Master Plan including zoning, trees, signs, noise and other components.\n\nCouncilmember Patel stated the resident advisory committee has only three applications not from all three sections and one position has been open for almost a year. Council President Harris stated she will ask the Mayor about the vacant position.\n\nCouncilmember Brescher explained the library board president changed how meetings are run and the Council liaison is not allowed to speak, vote or participate, making the position meaningless.\n\nCouncil President Harris stated she stood in for a meeting and was shocked at the change as she had previously been welcomed for input and allowed in closed sessions. She told the Mayor there is no reason for a Council liaison to sit as a potted plant.\n\nCouncilmember Brescher stated unless there is change in protocol or leadership it is very frustrating.\n\nCouncilmember Coyle stated there is debate whether liaisons have too much or too little influence and the current leadership is wonderful.\n\nCouncilmember Patel agreed liaisons should be able to cooperate with boards.\n\nCouncil President Harris stated she is liaison to Cultural Arts Commission where her input is welcome and requested, and a liaison is the liaison from that board to the administration.\n\nHearing no further comments from the public, Councilmember Brescher made a motion to close the public hearing, which was seconded by Councilmember Patil and duly carried.\n\n8.      REPORTS FROM ALL COUNCIL COMMITTEES\n\nNo reports were made.\n\n9.      POINTS OF LIGHT\n\nCouncil President Harris reminded everyone the next meeting is a combined meeting on Wednesday, November 12th.\n\n10.      ADJOURNMENT\n\nCouncil President Harris thanked the public for taking time from their schedules to attend and expressed hope they will continue to do so. She stated the six minutes will be restored next year.\n\nHaving no further business to discuss, on a motion made by Councilmember Brescher seconded by Councilmember Patil the meeting was adjourned at 8:39 p.m.\n\n\n_______________________________    ____________________________________________\nMargo Harris                                      Cheryl Russomanno, RMC\nCouncil President                     Municipal Clerk"

Events that Edison has traditionally done such as the Memorial Day Parade and the July 4th celebration will be enhanced to include America 250 celebrations and new events are being planned for all ages and all parts of the Township. As a lifelong resident of Edison, all of us are excited. Edison TV has been working hard creating a series of historic minutes that will be shown on TV this year.

He stated Council members should not view the salary as a primary income source and that the increase is unseemly, noting he had previously refused to place a similar ordinance on the agenda when he was Council President.\n\nAndrew Sellers, Castro Avenue, spoke about Ordinance 2273 and its potential impact on military recruitment and retention, noting that changes to military leave policies can affect whether servicemembers feel supported.\n\n[REVIEW: Speaker name unclear], Edison, opposed the Council salary increase and stated it appears designed to benefit one Council member without employment.\n\n[REVIEW: Speaker name unclear] Freeman, Edison, criticized the Department of Public Works' performance and questioned the Council salary increase.\n\nAnthony Dameron, Edison, expressed mixed views on the Mayor and Business Administrator raises but questioned whether Council responsibilities are changing to justify the salary increase. He suggested Council members should have more defined responsibilities or office support.\n\nZoom Barber, Pleasant Avenue, asked how the salary increase is justified, why the increase is 120%, whether there will be retroactive payment to January 1st, and whether complete plans will be posted online before Planning Board meetings.

She explained Planning Board agendas are posted online and plans can be obtained from the Engineering Department or through OPRA.\n\nDr. Nasser, Pleasant Avenue, stated the salary increase does not make sense at this point in the Council term and would be better timed before elections.

Council President Coyle indicated committee assignments would be made before February 4th.\n\n[REVIEW: Speaker name unclear], Edison, strongly opposed the Council salary increase and criticized the reduction of public speaking time to four minutes.\n\nHearing no further comments from the public, Councilmember [REVIEW: name unclear] made a motion to close the public hearing, which was seconded by Councilmember [REVIEW: name unclear] and duly carried.\n\n9.      REPORTS FROM ALL COUNCIL COMMITTEES\n\nNo committee reports were presented. Council President Coyle stated committee assignments will be made at the next meeting.\n\n10.      POINTS OF LIGHT\n\nCouncilmember Dima thanked the Department of Public Works for snow removal and the Water Department for addressing the water main break on Route 1.\n\nCouncilmember [REVIEW: name unclear] commended DPW for their responsiveness to snow removal issues.\n\nCouncil President Coyle thanked DPW, Public Safety, Police, Fire and all departments for their 24-hour snow removal efforts. He noted the Township has technology to track plow trucks and blade positions in real time. He announced the State of the Township Address will be held February 3rd at 7:00 p.m. at Pines Manor and is free and open to the public. He also announced the Valentine's Day Disability Dance will be held February 7th from 6:00 to 8:30 p.m. at the Minue Building.\n\nDISCUSSION ITEMS\n\nCouncilmember Brescher stated the Council's primary job is to review legislation and the budget, not to handle administrative matters that are the Mayor's responsibility. She noted that thoroughly reviewing the Township's budget deserves significant compensation and that the salary increase is justified if Council members perform their legislative duties properly.\n\nCouncilmember Kentos stated he has answered approximately 50 calls since taking office in January and has prevented about 12 residents from having to attend meetings by resolving their issues directly with the administration. He emphasized the job requires significant time and availability beyond just attending meetings.\n\nCouncilmember Patel thanked DPW and the administration for snow removal efforts and requested the Township explore acquiring equipment similar to equipment used in Canada that prevents snow from blocking driveways. Ms. Alves-Viveiros indicated this could be explored during budget planning. Councilmember Patel also asked about enforcement against vehicles that take parking spots after compliant residents move their cars during snow emergencies.\n\nCouncil President Coyle stated the Council salary of $38,500 is equivalent to what $1,200 from 1966 would be worth today adjusted for inflation. He stated the increase opens opportunities for middle class residents and youth to serve on Council, noting it has historically been rare for anyone under 30 to serve due to the financial constraints. He emphasized Council members are expected to be knowledgeable about finance, infrastructure, public safety and numerous other issues beyond just attending meetings and voting.\n\nCouncilmember Brescher announced she will be making a motion at the next meeting to restore six-minute speaking time for the public, and Council President Coyle agreed to place it on the agenda.\n\n11.      ADJOURNMENT\n\nHaving no further business to discuss, on a motion made by Councilmember [REVIEW: name unclear] seconded by Councilmember [REVIEW: name unclear] the meeting was adjourned at 7:51 p.m.\n\n\n_______________________________    ____________________________________________\nJoseph Coyle                       Cheryl Russomanno, RMC\nCouncil President                  Municipal Clerk"
